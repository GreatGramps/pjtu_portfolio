## About me

I started my virtual career on June 2017. I used Facebook back then as a platform to look for online job opportunities that are fit to my skills and expertise as a Computer Engineering student. I started out as a Transcriptionist for a local non-governmental organization. I took more project-based transcription job from there onwards. Here is a link to our project team members in one of the projects that I joined:

Right after that was when I found out about OnlineJobs.ph. I landed my first work as a virtual part timer on December 2018. That was when it all began. I started learning new things, mastering new skills one after another. I graduated March 2019 and worked as an Associate Software Engineer (QA Tester) for a company based in the Philippines.

I am organised, structured and attentive to detail. On personal level, I love communicating with different types of people. I am an introvert and was a bit associal when I was still a student. Due to this, I joined different types of online groups and met with different types of people with about the same interest as mine. From there, I learned how to communicate effectively with different types of people.

As of the moment, I am studying techniques and tools by attending online courses specifically about Testing for learning purposes and personal growth. I would be extremely happy to apply my knowledge from there to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” to become a senior-level software tester in 2 years.
